# Description

This resource allows you to create dynamic and easy to use menus through `alt` events. Think of it as a simple menu builder resource that takes the complexities of building your own Vue based menus completely out of the equation.

## Installing Dependencies / Installation

**I cannot stress this enough. Ensure you have NodeJS 13+ or you will have problems.**

-   [NodeJS 13+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
-   An Existing or New Gamemode
-   General Scripting Knowledge

After simply add the name of this resource to your `server.cfg` resource section.

`altv-os-menus`

Then simply clone this repository into your main server resources folder.

```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-os-menus
```

Ensure your `package.json` includes this property:

```json
"type": "module"
```
